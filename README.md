Timer and stopwatch React-Native app for iOS and Android

![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drahmel/youhavetimer/master/extra/example-screen.png)

# Purpose

There are a lot of countdown timer and stopwatch apps for both iOS and Android (and iOS now includes one in the bottom drawer). So you might ask, why another one? The reason for this project is twofold:

* Provide a real React-Native app on that works on both iOS and Android with as many professional attributes such as Crashlytics/Fabric rigging
* Cool app design UX/UI

If you have any contributions, please submit them!

# Running the App

These are standard for react-native but may expand as additional 3rd party packages are added.

## iOS

`react-native run-ios`

## Android

`react-native run-android`

# Notes

## Possibilities

It would be great if this app evolved to more than a simple timer app. Some future features might include:

* Naming countdown presets -- Name a preset for things such as "Get up and walk around" or "Guitar Practice" for easy setting of common durations
* Upload tracked times to other applications -- So it could be used for job tracking or other applications


## To-do

* Modify layout to work on phone and tablet
* Fix gradient

## Roadmap

Timer and stopwatch React-Native app for iOS and Android

# Purpose

There are a lot of countdown timer and stopwatch apps for both iOS and Android (and iOS now includes one in the bottom drawer). So you might ask, why another one? The reason for this project is twofold:

* Provide a real React-Native app on that works on both iOS and Android with as many professional attributes such as Crashlytics/Fabric rigging
* Cool app design UX/UI

These are standard for react-native but may expand as additional 3rd party packages are added.

## iOS

`react-native run-ios`

## Android

`react-native run-android`

# Notes

# youhavetimer
A real (but also example) timer and stopwatch React-Native app for iOS and Android.

# Purpose

There are a lot of countdown timer and stopwatch apps for both iOS and Android (and iOS now includes one in the bottom drawer). So you might ask, why another one? The reason for this project is twofold:

* Provide a real React-Native app on that works on both iOS and Android with as many professional attributes such as Crashlytics/Fabric rigging
* Cool app design UX/UI -- This should not be a generic timer app, but should have some style.

If you have any contributions, please submit them!

# Running the App

These are standard for react-native but may expand as additional 3rd party packages are added. Any special configuration will be included here. Remember in dev, if you have another react-native app running previously, you will have to close it and run `npm start` to launch the local web server.

## iOS

`react-native run-ios`

## Android

`react-native run-android`

# Notes

## Possibilities

It would be great if this app evolved to more than a simple timer app. Some future features might include:

* Naming countdown presets -- Name a preset for things such as "Get up and walk around" or "Guitar Practice" for easy setting of common durations
* Upload tracked times to other applications -- So it could be used for job tracking or other applications


## To-do

* Add image launch screen script
* Modify layout to work on phone and tablet
* Fix gradient
* Add Navigator

## Roadmap
